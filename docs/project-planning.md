- Research the following:
       - List Applications Researched: https://www.goodreads.com/
https://www.librarything.com/
https://bookish.netgalley.com/

       - List what you like about each site:
               - For Goodreads; I like how you can connect with other people using the same app.
               - For library thing; I like how with a free account you can add 200 books to your library and share it with other users.
               - For bookish; I like how there's a book club! This seems to be more of an aspiring writer website than to review books.
       - List what you do not like about each site:
               - For Goodreads:There's honestly not much I dislike about this. I actually love the layout of the website. It does seem a little simplistic, but I still like that.
               - For library thing; I really don't like how the website looks. It gives me early college library vibes and I don't like how it looks.
               - For bookish: I feel like there's too much going on on the home page. It feels more like a newsletter site than a website than to review books?
       - How my application will be different: I'm going for a more modern look, yet I still want it to be simplistic as well. I also want to go for darker colors to match the themes of the books. So like, reds, blacks, stuff like that.
